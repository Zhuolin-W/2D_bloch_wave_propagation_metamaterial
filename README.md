# Bloch Wave Propagation in a Periodic Metamaterial

Elastic bloch wave propagation in a 2D periodic metamaterial. Simulations have done with COMSOL Multiphysics (5.6.0) applying Floquet periodic boundary conditions.

Dispersion surfaces have been plotted with both Wolfram Mathematica (version 13.0.0 is needed) and Matlab (R2022a).
